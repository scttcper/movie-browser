    title: 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day',
    description: `Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator in this explosive action-adventure spectacle. Now he's one of the good guys, sent back in time to protect John Connor, the boy destined to lead the freedom fighters of the future. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother, a quintessential survivor who has been institutionalized for her warning of the nuclear holocaust she knows is inevitable. Together, the threesome must find a way to stop the ultimate enemy-the T-1000, the most lethal Terminator ever created. Co-written, produced and directed by James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic), this visual tour de force is also a touching human story of survival.`,

    description: `It's 2084 A.D. and Doug Quaid is haunted by recurring dreams about journeying to Earths closest planetary neighbor Mars. He lives in a time that has survived yet another world war and where Government elections are obsolete. His wife accuses him of fantasizing about Mars to escape their boring life-style. Yet, Quaid can't stop thinking about the oppressed Martian colonies under the harsh rule of the tyrant Cohaagen. A flashing advertisement, Call Rekall, where we make the impossible possible, draws Quaid into a vacation parlor. Here, fantasies are artificially implanted in the minds of those who desire to turn their dreams into reality. Quaid is intrigued by the role of an intelligence agent - on Mars. Something goes wrong with the procedure, unlocking thoughts that were erased from his mind. Quaid realizes that he's truly been to Mars, that he's not who he thinks he is and that even his wife is fake, a spy sent to monitor his new identify. Distant memories of a Martian woman, his past life and a menacing plan are invading his mind...`,
